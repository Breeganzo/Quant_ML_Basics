# Theory Section

This folder contains deep theoretical foundations for each week of the program as interactive Jupyter notebooks.

## 🎯 How This Curriculum is Organized

We have a **12-week practical curriculum** in `02_Daily_Coding/`, with comprehensive theory in each week's `THEORY.ipynb`. 

The `01_Theory/Foundation_Weeks_01-04/` folder contains extended reference materials for the foundational weeks.

## How to Use

1. **Read the THEORY.ipynb** in each week BEFORE starting daily notebooks
2. **Run the code cells** - theory is interactive with working examples!
3. **Focus on "Why This Matters"** sections - understand real-world applications
4. **Take notes by hand** for key formulas (helps retention)
5. **Prepare interview talking points** as you read

## Content Standards

Each theory notebook includes:
- **🎯 Learning Objectives**: What you'll learn and why it matters
- **🤔 Simple Explanations**: Plain-English explanations before math
- **💻 Working Code**: Every concept has runnable examples
- **📊 Visualizations**: Charts and plots to build intuition
- **⚠️ Common Mistakes**: Pitfalls to avoid in practice
- **🎓 Interview Tips**: What firms ask about each topic
