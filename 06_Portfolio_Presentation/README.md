## Common Question Responses

### "Walk me through your most interesting project"
Start with business problem, not technical details. Explain WHY before HOW.

### "What was the hardest part?"
Be specific. Show problem-solving ability. Discuss what didn't work first.

### "How do you know it's not overfit?"
List multiple techniques:
1. Purged cross-validation
2. Walk-forward testing
3. Out-of-sample holdout
4. Statistical significance tests
5. Deflated Sharpe ratio
6. Realistic transaction costs
7. Comparison to baselines

### "How would this scale?"
Discuss:
- Capacity constraints
- Latency considerations
- Data requirements
- Computational costs

### "What would break this strategy?"
Show self-awareness:
- Regime changes
- Alpha decay
- Crowding
- Black swan events
- Data quality issues

### "What would you do differently?"
Demonstrate growth mindset:
- More data sources
- Different algorithms
- Better infrastructure
- Extended time horizon
- Production deployment

## Final Thoughts

Your portfolio tells a story. Make sure it communicates:

1. **Technical depth** - You understand the math and algorithms
2. **Practical skills** - You can implement production-quality code
3. **Business awareness** - You think about costs, capacity, and real-world constraints
4. **Growth mindset** - You acknowledge limitations and seek improvement
5. **Communication** - You can explain complex concepts clearly

**The goal**: When an interviewer reviews your GitHub, they should think "I want to work with this person."
