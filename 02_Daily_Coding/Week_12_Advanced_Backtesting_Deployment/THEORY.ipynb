    "## 🎯 What You'll Learn This Week (The Final Boss!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've made it to the final week. This is where theory meets reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Hard Truth:** Most backtested strategies fail in live trading. Why?\n",
    "- They didn't account for transaction costs\n",
    "- They overfitted to historical data\n",
    "- They had unrealistic assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**By the end of this week, you'll know how to:**\n",
    "- Test strategies like a real quant (walk-forward, not random splits!)\n",
    "- Account for ALL the costs that eat your profits\n",
    "- Size positions to survive drawdowns\n",
    "- Deploy models to production\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "> \"A strategy that makes 10% in backtest but loses money live is worthless. A strategy that makes 2% in backtest AND 2% live is gold.\" - Quantitative PM\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🤔 Why Walk-Forward? (The Real Reason)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem with Normal Backtesting:**\n",
    "Imagine you're in 2020 and you test a strategy on 2010-2020 data. Your model \"knows\" about COVID, the 2018 vol spike, etc. But in 2010, those hadn't happened yet!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Walk-forward simulates ACTUAL trading:**\n",
    "- Train on 2010-2015, test on 2016\n",
    "- Train on 2010-2016, test on 2017\n",
    "- Train on 2010-2017, test on 2018... and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you only test on data the model has NEVER seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Representation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Time -->   [======Train======][Test]\n",
    "              [======Train======][Test]\n",
    "                 [======Train======][Test]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parameters (In Plain English):\n",
    "- **Training window**: How much history to learn from (e.g., 3 years)\n",
    "- **Test window**: How long to test before retraining (e.g., 3 months)\n",
    "- **Step size**: How often to retrain (e.g., monthly)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expanding vs Rolling Window - Which to Use?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | What It Does | When to Use It |\n",
    "|--------|-------------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Expanding** | Keeps adding data | Markets with lasting patterns |\n",
    "| **Rolling** | Fixed window, drops old data | Markets that change fast |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip:** Most quants use expanding windows for general strategies, rolling for high-frequency/regime-dependent models.\n",

    "## Part 2: Transaction Costs (The Profit Killer!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Why This Section is CRITICAL\n",
    "\n",
    "Many beginners build strategies showing 20% annual returns... then lose money in live trading. Why? **TRANSACTION COSTS.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you trade, you pay a \"tax.\" If you trade too often, these taxes eat all your profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Trading Costs (Know Your Enemy):\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Commission/Fees** 💰\n",
    "> The obvious cost - what your broker charges\n",
    "- Typical: $0.005/share or 0.01-0.1% per trade\n",
    "- Interactive Brokers: ~$1-5 per trade\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Bid-Ask Spread** 📊\n",
    "> The hidden cost most beginners forget!\n",
    "- Apple (liquid): $150.00 bid / $150.01 ask = 0.007% cost\n",
    "- Small cap (illiquid): $10.00 bid / $10.10 ask = 1% cost!!\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Market Impact** 📈\n",
    "> YOUR trade moves the price against you\n",
    "- Small trade: negligible\n",
    "- Large trade ($1M+): you're buying so much, price rises BEFORE you finish\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Slippage** ⏱️\n",
    "> Price changes while your order executes\n",
    "- You want $100, you get $100.05\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Cost Formula:\n",
    "$$\\text{Total Cost} = \\text{Commission} + \\frac{\\text{Spread}}{2} + \\text{Impact} + \\text{Slippage}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Example:\n",
    "| Cost Type | Amount |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|\n",
    "| Commission | 0.01% |\n",
    "| Half-spread | 0.025% |\n",
    "| Slippage | 0.01% |\n",
    "| **Total per trade** | **0.045%** |\n",
    "| **Round trip (buy + sell)** | **0.09%** |\n",
    "\n",
    "If you trade daily, that's 0.09% × 252 = **22.7% per year** eaten by costs!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turnover Calculation:\n",
    "$$\\text{Turnover} = \\frac{\\sum |w_t - w_{t-1}|}{2}$$\n",
