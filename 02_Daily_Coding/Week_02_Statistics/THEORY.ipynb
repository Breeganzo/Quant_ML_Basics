    "### 🤔 What is a Probability Distribution? (Simple Explanation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a weather forecast, but for stock returns:\n",
    "- \"70% chance of sun\" → \"70% chance the stock goes up\"\n",
    "- \"20% chance of rain\" → \"20% chance the stock goes down\"\n",
    "- \"10% chance of storm\" → \"10% chance of a market crash\"\n",

    "A probability distribution tells us ALL the possible outcomes and how likely each one is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Traders Care About This\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world example:** You're a risk manager at a bank. Your boss asks: \"What's the worst-case scenario for our portfolio tomorrow?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "You can't know the future, but you CAN use probability distributions to say: \"There's a 95% chance we won't lose more than $1 million.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Probability Density Function (PDF)**: A fancy way of drawing a curve that shows which outcomes are more likely.\n",
    "- Tall curve at a point = that outcome is very likely\n",
    "- Short curve = that outcome is rare\n",

    "**Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: Answers the question \"What's the probability we get less than X?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(x) = P(X \\leq x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} f(t) dt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Translation: This formula just adds up all the probabilities from negative infinity to x*\n",

    "**Expected Value (Mean)**: If you played this game 1,000 times, what would you get on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x \\cdot f(x) dx$$\n",
