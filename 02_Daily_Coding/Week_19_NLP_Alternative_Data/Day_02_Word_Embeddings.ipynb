    "WORD EMBEDDINGS BEST PRACTICES FOR FINANCE\n",
    "============================================\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DATA PREPARATION\n",
    "   - Use domain-specific text (SEC filings, earnings calls, news)\n",
    "   - Preserve financial bigrams (interest_rate, earnings_per_share)\n",
    "   - Consider keeping stopwords for embedding training\n",
    "   - Clean but don't over-process financial terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "2. MODEL SELECTION\n",
    "   - Word2Vec Skip-gram: Better for rare financial terms\n",
    "   - Word2Vec CBOW: Faster, better for common terms\n",
    "   - GloVe pre-trained: Good baseline, transfer learning\n",
    "   - FastText: Better OOV handling with subword information\n",
    "\n",
    "3. HYPERPARAMETERS\n",
    "   - vector_size: 100-300 (100 often sufficient for finance)\n",
    "   - window: 5-10 (larger for capturing financial context)\n",
    "   - min_count: 5-10 for large corpus, 1-2 for small\n",
    "   - epochs: More for smaller corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "4. EVALUATION\n",
    "   - Word similarity tasks (financial synonyms)\n",
    "   - Analogy tasks (stock:stocks::bond:?)\n",
    "   - Downstream task performance (sentiment, classification)\n",
    "   - Qualitative inspection of nearest neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "5. DEPLOYMENT\n",
    "   - Save KeyedVectors for inference (smaller, faster)\n",
    "   - Consider quantization for production\n",
    "   - Handle OOV words gracefully\n",

    "WORD EMBEDDINGS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS\n",
    "====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCEPTUAL:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1: Explain the difference between Word2Vec Skip-gram and CBOW.\n",
    "A: Skip-gram predicts context words given center word (better for rare words).\n",
    "   CBOW predicts center word given context (faster, better for frequent words).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Why do word embeddings capture semantic meaning?\n",
    "A: Words in similar contexts have similar embeddings. The distributional \n",
    "   hypothesis: \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\" Training\n",
    "   optimizes vectors so semantically related words are geometrically close.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What's the advantage of GloVe over Word2Vec?\n",
    "A: GloVe uses global co-occurrence statistics (entire corpus at once),\n",
    "   while Word2Vec uses local context windows. GloVe often performs better\n",
    "   on analogy tasks and can be more efficient to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: How would you handle out-of-vocabulary words in production?\n",
    "A: Options include: (1) Return zero/random vector, (2) Use subword \n",
    "   embeddings (FastText), (3) Find similar in-vocabulary word, \n",
    "   (4) Use character-level models, (5) Hash trick for unknown words.\n",
    "\n",
    "PRACTICAL:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: How would you build a financial sentiment analyzer using embeddings?\n",
    "A: Create positive/negative seed word centroids, compute document embedding\n",
    "   as weighted average of word vectors, measure cosine similarity to \n",
    "   each centroid. The closer centroid determines sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: What's a good embedding dimension for financial NLP?\n",
    "A: 100-300 dimensions typically work well. 100d often sufficient for \n",
    "   finance-specific tasks. Larger dimensions may overfit on small corpora.\n",
    "   Validate using downstream task performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: How do you evaluate embedding quality?\n",
    "A: (1) Intrinsic: word similarity correlation, analogy accuracy\n",
    "   (2) Extrinsic: downstream task performance (sentiment, classification)\n",
    "   (3) Qualitative: inspect nearest neighbors for known relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: When would you train custom embeddings vs use pre-trained?\n",
    "A: Custom: Large domain corpus, domain-specific vocabulary, \n",
    "   specialized semantics (financial jargon means different things).\n",
    "   Pre-trained: Limited data, general concepts, quick prototyping.\n",
    "   Hybrid: Fine-tune pre-trained on domain data.\n",
